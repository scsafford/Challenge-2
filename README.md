# Challenge-2
This was the portfolio challenge.  The purpose of this challenge was to build a portfolio of our work from scratch using what we have learned in class so far.  This included HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and media queries to make our page friendly on different viewing platforms.  I hope you enjoy my work.
